Interpretation of Scatter Plots:
1. Humidity vs Rain
  - The plot showed that most point clustered around under rain 0, meanings that on most days there were no rainfall, regardless of the humidity
  - The plot showed that most point that has rainfall (clustered at rain > 0) has humidity > 0, meaning when rain does happen, it mostly happens on the day with higher humidity.
  - This confirmed that high humidity is associated with rainfall (high correlation), while low humidity day rarely has rainfall.
  - Therefore, humidity is a strong predictor of rainfall.
2. Visibility vs Wind Speed
  - The plot showed that on most day, most point clustered at visibility > 0, suggesting that there are little to no rainfall, storm or any sign of bad weather in the provided dataset.
  - The plot showed that points scatter along the y axis (wind speed), which imply that there are no relationship between visibility and wind speed.
  - Visibility and wind speed do not have a strong overall correlation
  - While poor visibility sometimes means that it's a stormy day (high wind speed), but the plot showed that it seem not to be the case
