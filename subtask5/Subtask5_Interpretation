1. Humidity vs Wind Speed
 - The two groups (Y = rain tomorrow, N = no rain tomorrow) overlap across almost the entire plot. The red and green points are intermixed with no clear separation, making it very hard to draw a boundary that distinguishes the two classes. The overlap is especially dense in the central region around humidity 70–85% and wind speed 8–12 mph, where both groups appear equally. Any decision line or curve in this space would misclassify a large number of points.
 - Both Y and N points are dispersed across the full range of humidity values (45–95%) and wind speeds (3–22 mph). There is a weak tendency for Y points to cluster slightly more at higher humidity levels, while N points are somewhat more present at lower humidity levels (<60%). However, these differences are minor. Overall, the classes form a diffuse cloud without distinct clusters, which limits the usefulness of this variable pair for prediction.
 
2. Max Temperature vs Rain
 - Most points align tightly along the x-axis where rain = 0, forming a dense mix of red and green points. This indicates that on most days, there is no rain, regardless of whether it rains tomorrow. The overlap along this axis is very strong, making it difficult to separate Y and N with a decision boundary. For points above the x-axis, where rain > 0, there is a slight increase in Y points compared to N, but the overlap still persists, so classification remains challenging.
 - The plot forms a strong L-shaped pattern. Nearly all points are concentrated at rain = 0, spanning a wide range of maximum temperatures (40–110°F). Within this cluster, both classes appear, showing no clear separation. For cases where rain > 0, Y points appear more often than N, especially in the temperature range of 70–85°F with moderate to high rainfall. This suggests that rain today is associated with a higher chance of rain tomorrow. However, the presence of N points in the same areas reduces the strength of this signal. Overall, today’s rain provides some predictive value for tomorrow’s rain, but the effect is modest compared to the high overlap.
